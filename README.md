# ChatBot-For-Stardew-Valley

This project aims to develop a chatbot that can answer questions based on content mainly from StardewValley wiki. The initial phase focuses on training a robust NLP model using data from a single wiki page. Later phases will involve expanding the data to multiple pages and integrating the model into a full-fledged system with front-end and back-end components.
